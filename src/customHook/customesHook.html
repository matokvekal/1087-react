Benefits of Custom Hooks:
</br>
Reusability: You can extract component logic into reusable functions.
Separation of Concerns: You can separate your logic based on its concern, rather than the lifecycle methods of a component.
Simplicity: They allow you to use state and lifecycle methods in function components without switching to class components.
How to create a custom hook:
</br>
Create a new function with a name starting with "use".
Add any logic you want within this function, and if necessary, use other hooks inside it.
Return something â€“ it could be data, a function for modifying that data, etc.
</br>
Important Notes:
</br>
Don't call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. Always use Hooks at the top level of your React functions.
Only call Hooks from React functions. Don't call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions.
Remember, custom hooks are just a pattern. They don't use any special React features behind the scenes. It's just a way to use hooks and other
 functions to abstract and reuse stateful logic across components.
